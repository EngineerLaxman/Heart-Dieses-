# Overview of the Machine Learning Project

The heart disease prediction project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical features. The steps are:

#Data Preparation:

Dataset: A CSV file (medicaldata.csv) is used, containing medical features and labels indicating the presence of heart disease.

Features: Includes pregnant, glucose, bp, skin, insulin, bmi, pedigree, and age.

Target Variable: label, which indicates whether heart disease is present.

#Data Processing:

Loading Data: The dataset is loaded into a DataFrame with specified column names.

Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected from the dataset to be used for model training.

#Model Training and Testing:

Model: A Decision Tree Classifier is used to build the predictive model.

Training: The model is trained on the training dataset to learn patterns related to heart disease.

Prediction: The model makes predictions on the test dataset.

Evaluation:

Accuracy: The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated by calculating its accuracy, which reflects how well the model predicts heart disease based on the test data.
